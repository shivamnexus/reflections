What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Fill in your answer here

    If versions are automatically saved then we will use a little more memory
    but it will be safer because we can go lazy sometimes and don't manually 
    update our versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Fill in your answer here

    Because we have to deal with multiple files when we are working on a project
    but on Google docs we are dealing with single file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Fill in your answer here
    By git log command we can see the list of all changes that we made and by
    git diff command we can compare two versions of programs

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Fill in your answer here
    Because we have choice to go back and pursue another path
